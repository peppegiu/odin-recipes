        <p class="description">These Italian ricotta cookies with an almond-flavored glaze and colorful candy sprinkles are very good!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul class="Ingredients">
            <li><strong>Ricotta:</strong>Of course, you'll need ricotta! A 15-ounce package to be exact.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>You'll need two types of sugar: white sugar for the dough, confectioners' sugar for the glaze.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong>Two sticks of butter add moisture and richness.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong>Eggs lend moisture and act as a binder, which means they help hold the dough together.</li>
            <li><strong>Extracts:</strong>Vanilla extract goes into the dough, while almond extract goes into the sugary glaze.</li>
            <li><strong>Flour:</strong>All-purpose flour gives the cookies structure. Plus, they help the dough come together.</li>
            <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong>Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which mean they help the cookies rise:</li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong>Stir 5 tablespoons of milk into the glaze to create the perfect spreadable consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprinkles:</strong>These Italian ricotta cookies are traditionally topped with colorful sprinkles. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol class="steps">
            <li><strong>Make the dough:</strong>Beat the wet ingredients in a bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients. Gradually stir the dry mixture into the wet ingredients.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the cookies:</strong>Roll the dough into balls and bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden.</li>
            <li><strong>Glaze the cookies:</strong>Mix the glaze ingredients together until well-combined. Spoon over the warm cookies and top with sprinkles.
            </li>
