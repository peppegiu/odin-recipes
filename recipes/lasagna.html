        <h2>Lasagna Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat</strong>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
            <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg</strong>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
        </ul>
