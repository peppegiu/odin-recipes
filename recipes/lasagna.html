            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
